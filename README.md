## Gabriel Araujo

I'm a Brazilian software engineer currently living in Berlin

I was raised playing SNES and PC games. 
This passion for videogames and technology made me pursue the software engineering career, and also the frustation for not being able to become a cop :policeman:!

I'm a rubist by heart, but also have been playing with React, Elixir and the Godot game engine, which uses a Python like programming language called GDScript.

Feel free to check my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabrielgaraujo/) out to see what I'm doing nowadays!
